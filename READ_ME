Plagiarism Catcher

This is a program designed to search through a set of text documents and determine which documents were likely plagiarized. It uses a hash function to sort through all the words. Hash collisions are used to detect cheating; more collisions between documents means a higher chance of plagiarism.

User instructions
1) After unzipping the given zip file, type "make" into the command line to compile the code. There should only be one .cpp file (the main file).
2) Check to see if the compilation worked by typing "ls" into the command line. There should be a file called "plagiarismCatcher".
3) Now type "./plagiarismCatcher filePath chunkSize threshold" to run the program.
	-replace filePath with the name of the folder that holds the documents. NOTE: the folder containing all the documents should be in the same location as the program.
	-replace chunkSize with the desired chunk size. A chunk is a fixed number of words that will be passed into the hash function and checked for collisions.
	-replace threshold with the minimum number of collisions to be considered plagiarism. The program will only print out the file pairs that have more collisions than the threshold.
4) The output will be formated: "numberOfCollisions: file1, file2".
